# Road map

## Documentation

Needed. :)

- websms.md
- privatedial.md
- README.md

## PrivateDial

- Make IVR custom-able
- Debug MiniVM access messages.

### Put in documentation

- Note, Presence is only supported for Sangama/Digium phones, not for softphones.

## Music on hold

- Script that converts sound files to wav 8000 Hz mono

## AutoBan

- Sanitize conf settings. Issue warning and use defaults when invalid settings are detected.

## WebSMS

- Sanitize conf settings. Issue warning and use defaults when invalid settings are detected.

## Asterisk modules

- check what modules are needed and avoid loading others. This will help get rid of error messages during startup.

## Dependencies

- Reorganize. Use git submodules?
